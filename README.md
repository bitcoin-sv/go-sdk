# BSV BLOCKCHAIN | Software Development Kit for Go

Welcome to the BSV Blockchain Libraries Project, the comprehensive Go SDK designed to provide an updated and unified layer for developing scalable applications on the BSV Blockchain. This SDK addresses the limitations of previous tools by offering a fresh, peer-to-peer approach, adhering to SPV, and ensuring privacy and scalability.

## Objective

The BSV Blockchain Libraries Project aims to structure and maintain a middleware layer of the BSV Blockchain technology stack. By facilitating the development and maintenance of core libraries, it serves as an essential toolkit for developers looking to build on the BSV Blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the SDK, run:

```bash
go install github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a [simple example](https://goplay.tools/snippet/bnsS-pA56ob) of using the SDK to create and sign a transaction:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	wif "github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/compat/wif"
	"github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/transaction"
	"github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/transaction/unlocker"
)

func main() {
	tx := transaction.NewTransaction()

	unlockingScriptTemplate, _ := p2pkh.Unlock(priv, nil)
   if err := tx.AddInputFrom(
		"11b476ad8e0a48fcd40807a111a050af51114877e09283bfa7f3505081a1819d",
		0,
		"76a9144bca0c466925b875875a8e1355698bdcc0b2d45d88ac",
		1500,
		unlockingScriptTemplate,
	); err!= nil {
      log.Fatal(err.Error())
   }

	_ = tx.PayToAddress("1AdZmoAQUw4XCsCihukoHMvNWXcsd8jDN6", 1000)

	priv, _ := ec.PrivateKeyFromWif("KznvCNc6Yf4iztSThoMH6oHWzH9EgjfodKxmeuUGPq5DEX5maspS")

	if err := tx.Sign(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err.Error())
	}
	log.Printf("tx: %s\n", tx)
}

```

See the [Go Doc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk) for a complete list of available modules and functions.
